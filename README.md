# Simple Tweet Database

## Compile
A simple ´make´ should do it

## Run
´make run´

## File structure and organization
All sources should be under ´src´. At src's top level there should be only code useful for the interface and the database. The rest should be under either ´src/interface´ or ´src/database´.

The ´tests´ directory contains code dedicated to generate and run tests. All test data should be stored in the ´data´ subdirectory
